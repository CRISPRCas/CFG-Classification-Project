## Case Study

### Case 1

```
File Name:
gpt-4o-mini

CFG:
S -> A | A A | S | x | y C S z
A -> x B C y y | C x y S x | B
B -> y y
C -> y | x x z B

String:
xyyxxzyyyyxyyyyy

Label:
True

LLM Response:
To determine if the string "xyyxxzyyyyxyyyyy" can be derived from the given context-free grammar (CFG), we can analyze the production rules and try to match the string step by step.

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The string has a length of 17 characters.
   - The string consists of several characters, including `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Understanding Production Rules**:
   Let's rewrite the rules for clarity:
   - **S** can produce:
     - **A**
     - **A A**
     - **S** (recursive)
     - `x`
     - `y C S z`
   - **A** can produce:
     - `x B C y y`
     - `C x y S x`
     - **B**
   - **B** can produce:
     - `y y`
   - **C** can produce:
     - `y`
     - `x x z B`

3. **Trying to Form the String**:
   We can analyze the string from its structure and the allowed productions.

   - Starting with S:
     We will particularly note that the string has a central `z` in `xyyxxzyyyyxyyyyy`. So we can focus on the production of `C` containing `z`.

   - Check possible derivations for `S`:
     Based on the string, we need to produce beginning characters `x`, `y`, and the `z`.
     Trying `S → y C S z` seems feasible. Let’s set `S = y C S z`.

     - The first `y` consumes the first character of the string.
     - Then we would need to derive `C` which should produce some characters followed by another `S`, and then the final `z`.

4. **Determining `C` and further S**:
   To match with the string:
   - Let's say `C` derives to `y` (choosing the simplest form). So we have:
     `S → y y S z`.
     We need second `y` from `C` to be `y`, thus now we have:
     - Our derivational tree starts to produce `y` along with `C` and another `S` resulting.
   
5. **Looking at remaining string**:
   After consuming `yy(` from `S`, we now have `xxzyyyyxyyyyy`. 
   At this point, the new S has to derive `xx` followed by additional characters.
   - We look indeed for derivation for `S` that can consume `xx`, we can derive:
   - The next `xx` follows via `A → x B C y y`, which allows derivational increase.

6. **Develop Further**:
   Continuing deriving characters `y` allows through `B`. We would have then satisfied the string's beginning.

   - As we descend through matchings and productions, we encounter possibilities of generating remaining strings including `yyyxyyyyy`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   By exploring these productions recursively and deeply implying mutual recursion from `S` which generates all possibilities, we successfully derive:

   `
   Find all possible productions recursively leading to each character. If able to resolve to S producing the entire string, string derives from the CFG.
   `

Final verification implies heavier matching to find `yyyxyyyyy` could continue resolving.

Therefore:

**Return**: **True** - The string "xyyxxzyyyyxyyyyy" can be derived from the CFG rules provided.
```

Error: Note that "Trying `S → y C S z` seems feasible. Let’s set `S = y C S z`." is not correct.

### Case 2
```
File Name:
gpt-4o-mini

CFG:
S -> ] ] 1 | THEN | IF 1 THEN ) | WHILE ELSE 1
IF -> ELSE ( WHILE | ] 1 )
THEN -> ELSE | )
ELSE -> 0 WHILE [ LOOP 0 | IF | ) IF THEN S | WHILE ) IF THEN | ELSE ( ELSE ELSE S
WHILE -> 1
LOOP -> [ ( THEN 1 WHILE | 1 ]

String:
01[1]0

Label:
True

LLM Response:
To determine whether the string "01[1]0" can be derived from the provided Context-Free Grammar (CFG), let's analyze the structure of the string with respect to the grammar rules.

1. **Identifying Components**: The string is "01[1]0". We note that it starts with a digit '0', contains a '[' character, then has '1', followed by a ']' character, and ends with a digit '0'.

2. **Applying the Grammar**:
   - The rule for `ELSE` can be relevant here because the string starts with '0' and will potentially continue with other rules:
     - `ELSE -> 0 WHILE [ LOOP 0` suggests the possibility since it starts with '0'.
   - Expanding `ELSE`:
     - From `0 WHILE [ LOOP 0`, let's check how that might fit. 
     - `WHILE` must subsequently produce '1', because `WHILE -> 1`.
     - Next, we would expand `LOOP`, which must match `[ THEN 1 WHILE`.
   - To fit, we can likely derive it as follows:
     - From `ELSE`, we can derive `0 WHILE [ LOOP0`.
     - Continue expanding with `WHILE -> 1`, so we get `0 1 [ LOOP 0`.
     - For `[ LOOP`:
       - This can fit with some forms mentioned, like getting `THEN` to produce `] 1`.
  
3. **Placement of Components**: The structure seems to allow:
   - Initial '0' then allows space for '1', then brackets around it forming usage of `LOOP`, suggesting valid fits based on rules.

4. **Final Assembly**: 
   - Thus we can work backwards:
     - From `0 WHILE [ ... 0`, a proper combination exists meaning we get the structures to situate further on chaining.

Following all this logical and structural deduction, we can conclude:

**The string "01[1]0" can be derived from the given CFG. Thus, the result is: True.**
```

Error: Note that "like getting `THEN` to produce `] 1`." is not correct.

### Case 3
```
File Name:
gpt-4o-mini

CFG:
S -> z S | B A B x S | C z z x | x S A | B
A -> x x y | y y A y y | A C A | S | x S B z
B -> z z S
C -> B B C S z | x x y | B C z z | A z y | C C A z A

String:
zzxxyzyzzx

Label:
True

LLM Response:
To determine if the string "zzxxyzyzzx" can be derived from the given context-free grammar (CFG), we can analyze the production rules step by step. 

The grammar has the following rules:
- S -> z S | B A B x S | C z z x | x S A | B
- A -> x x y | y y A y y | A C A | S | x S B z
- B -> z z S
- C -> B B C S z | x x y | B C z z | A z y | C C A z A

We need to see if we can derive "zzxxyzyzzx" from the starting symbol S.

1. Start with S. 
   
2. Since the string starts with "zz", we can consider the production S -> B. 
   
3. Using B -> z z S allows us to parse the first two 'z's:
   - Apply B -> z z S:
     - Current string: "zzxxyzyzzx"
     - Remaining part after using B: "xxyzyzzx"

4. Now we have S remaining, so we need to derive "xxyzyzzx". We will substitute for S again. 
   
5. Check possible productions from S:
   - We could potentially use S -> x S A or any other valid derivation combination.

6. However, for simplicity, let’s try another substitution using the grammar rules. Let's see if S can produce 'xxyzyzzx'.
   - Notably, A must derive part of "xxyzy".

7. By continuously back substituting, activating each rule, and checking the string composition, we can find we will match the structure.

After various attempts at substitution and seeing if we can continuously hit the sections of the string:

- Parsing through careful attempts using productions mainly from A and B, we find that the ultimate structure of A and B allows us to match with 'y'.
- The only key is ensuring each derivation holds to residual parts leading to first 'z' and pairs in 'A'.

Following through multiple paths through the CFG rules isn't simple, but consistently replacing often leads to derivations.

The detailed derivation would yield positive outcomes through intricate placements for strings of this length.

Ultimately, following all possible derivations with rigorous checks leads us to confirm that the original string "zzxxyzyzzx" can indeed be derived from the CFG provided.

Thus, the answer is:

**True**
```

Error: Note that "A must derive part of "xxyzy"." is not correct.

### Case 4
```
File Name:
gpt-4o-mini

CFG:
S -> ] ] 1 | THEN | IF 1 THEN ) | WHILE ELSE 1
IF -> ELSE ( WHILE | ] 1 )
THEN -> ELSE | )
ELSE -> 0 WHILE [ LOOP 0 | IF | ) IF THEN S | WHILE ) IF THEN | ELSE ( ELSE ELSE S
WHILE -> 1
LOOP -> [ ( THEN 1 WHILE | 1 ]

String:
[]][][]([][0)(]]1]](0)01[

Label:
False

LLM Response:
To determine if the string "[]][][]([][0)(]]1]](0)01[" can be derived from the provided context-free grammar (CFG), we will analyze the rules and how we might construct the string according to those rules.

Let's break down the string and see if we can derive it step by step from the grammar rules:

1. **Length and Composition**: The string consists of characters including brackets `[`, `]`, digits `0`, `1`, and parentheses `(`, `)`. The presence of certain characters hints at potential constructions based on the grammar.

2. **Starting Point**: The CFG begins the derivation with `S`. According to the rules, we can derive `S` into several forms, but we need to focus on a combination that could lead us to our target string.

3. **Examining Potential Derivations**: We must manually attempt to match portions of the string to the productions of `S`, `IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, etc. 

   The options for `S` include:
   - `] ] 1`
   - `THEN`
   - `IF 1 THEN )`
   - `WHILE ELSE 1`

   The string starts with `[][`, which suggests a sequence of brackets. This could relate to how we might derive something with an `ELSE`, as `ELSE` has derived elements using brackets.

4. **Incrementally Building Strings Using Grammar Rules**:
   - Start with the possibility of deriving using `WHILE ELSE 1` from `S`, checking if `ELSE` can be formed properly.
   - Examine `ELSE` and see what strings can be derived that fit the pattern.
   - Continue breaking down until you either exhaust possibilities or find a match.

5. **Final Validation**: Go through steps for each case to try deriving progressively more characters of the target string using substitutions allowed by the CFG.

Given the intricate nature of the string and CFG and without engaging in exhaustive derivation steps here in detail, it does appear that the structure and character placements in the string do not align seamlessly with any chaining or recursive form allowed by the CFG, especially concerning the number and position of brackets and parentheses.

Therefore, after consideration, the answer is:

**False** - The string "[]][][]([][0)(]]1]](0)01[" cannot be derived from the given context-free grammar.
```

### Case 5
```
File Name:
gpt-4o

CFG:
S -> BETA ) + | @ | S S S ALPHA @
ALPHA -> ) | S
BETA -> @ | ( GAMMA S S BETA | ( @ )
GAMMA -> @ GAMMA BETA | / ALPHA ALPHA ALPHA / | ( | S

String:
@)+

Label:
True

LLM Response:
To determine if the string "@)+" can be derived from the given CFG, we will try to construct a derivation starting from the initial non-terminal symbol \( S \).

Let's examine the grammar rules:

- \( S \to \text{BETA } ) + \)
- \( S \to @ \)
- \( S \to SSS \text{ ALPHA } @ \)
- \( ALPHA \to ) \)
- \( ALPHA \to S \)
- \( BETA \to @ \)
- \( BETA \to ( \text{ GAMMA } S S \text{ BETA } \)
- \( BETA \to ( @ ) \)
- \( GAMMA \to @ \text{ GAMMA } \text{ BETA } \)
- \( GAMMA \to / \text{ ALPHA ALPHA ALPHA } / \)
- \( GAMMA \to ( \)
- \( GAMMA \to S \)

We're trying to derive the string \( "@)+" \):

1. Since the string starts with "@", we could use \( S \to @ \). However, that would not allow us to derive the remaining characters \( )+ \), so \( S \to @ \) is not sufficient alone.

2. Now consider \( S \to \text{BETA } ) + \):
   - For "BETA", there is a rule \( BETA \to @ \), thus this gives us the string \( "@)+" \).

3. Therefore, if we choose \( S \to \text{BETA } ) + \) and apply \( BETA \to @ \), we end up with "@)+" which matches the string we need to derive.

Conclusion:
Given the rules of the CFG, the string "@)+" can be derived. Thus, the answer is:

**True**
```

Note: Correct.

### Case 6
```
File Name:
gpt-4o

CFG:
S -> x y | x | A x y x z | y | x S y y
A -> S | y x A B | B B B x S | x
B -> y | A y z y C | z C x y | z A y x | A A C
C -> x S z S C | y y y | z A S

String:
xyxxxxyyyyxyxzyy

Label:
True

LLM Response:
To determine if the given string "xyxxxxyyyyxyxzyy" can be derived from the provided CFG, we need to consider all possible derivations starting from the initial symbol S.

1. **Derivation using S -> x S y y:**
   - Starting with `S`, apply `S -> x S y y` repeatedly; try deriving similar structures or using parts of the string to match rules:
   - `S -> x S y y` -> `x S y y`
     - Consider matching `x` at the start and `y` and `y` at the end. We have `x S y y`. 
     - Now, `S` in `x S y y` has derivations like `x y`, `x`, `y`, `x S y y`, `A x y x z`.
     - The challenge is matching the remaining elements, especially central validively “caught” by rules.

2. **Exploring nested derivations with A and B:**
   - Given the flexibility of the rules defined for `A` and `B`, the derivations can become complex.
   - Matching central characters needs a nested and complex application of different rules as observed:
      - `A -> B B B x S` and `B -> A y z y C` can follow a pattern where intermediate pressing between structures can form matches.
   - The overlap needs direct derivation into S's sequences by yielding replacements that are competitive and reliant.

3. **Attempts to form initial and final sequences directly:**
   - By S -> x y | x | A x y x z | y | x S y y:
     - `S -> A x y x z` has a direct implication for deriving central sequences.
     - With the initial repetitive `xy`, discuss rules for A justified from `S` itself while an incorporation into segments gives a necessary structure.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Each component of the string, through recursive replacement of S, A, B, and C using derivations seen from starter rules, builds valid structures.
   - Formulating an overview of derivations while recognizing hidden overlaps with minimal unnecessary additions derives the given string.
  
Since we can hierarchically and structurally decode parts with corresponding strings from these rules, the conclusion is that by unfolding them comprehensively, `True` (the string can indeed be derived from the grammar provided).
```

Error: "`S -> x S y y` -> `x S y y`" is not correct.

## Summary

Through the above case study, we found that for short sequences, the LLM is able to carefully perform reasoning. However, for long sequences, the LLM mainly relies on somewhat inaccurate analysis and guesses to reach conclusions. Surprisingly, in such cases, the LLM’s accuracy can exceed 60%, though we do not yet understand the underlying principles.

In comparison, 4o-mini and 3.5-turbo are more balanced, with 4o-mini performing better. The 4o model is more conservative and tends to classify results as False.
